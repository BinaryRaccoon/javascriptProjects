        <h1>Functions and Arrays</h1>
        <p>The function is created and allows you to find the perimeter, area, and volume easily. 
           <br />You use the function and an array to first find the perimeter of your first cube, which
           <br />has a length of 2 meters, a width of 3 meters, and a height of 4 meters:</p>
        <h3 id="perimeterOne" class="solutions"></h3>
        <p>You use the same function to find the area of that same cube:</p>
        <h3 id="areaOne" class="solutions"></h3>
        <p>Once again, you use the same function to find the volume of that cube:</p>
        <h3 id="volumeOne" class="solutions"></h3>

        <p>Now, you can use this same function to find the dimensions of another cube.
           <br />Let's say that this cube has a length of 1 meter, a width of 2 meters, 
           <br />and a height of 3 meters:</p>
        <h3 id="perimeterTwo" class="solutions"></h3>
        <p>It's easy to find the area of our second cube: </p>
        <h3 id="areaTwo" class="solutions"></h3>
        <p>We still use the same function to find the volume of the second cube:</p>
        <h3 id="volumeTwo" class="solutions"></h3>
        <p>As you can see, with just one 7-line function, as well as a bit
           <br />more javascript, we can find anything from the perimeter of 
           <br />of the first cube to the volume of the second cube.</p>
